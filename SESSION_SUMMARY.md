# Session Summary - MO2 Setup Progress & Protontricks Removal

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Session Focus:** Fix MO2 setup progress tracking, remove protontricks, add Steam restart

---

## 1. Fixed Progress Tracking Bug

### Issue
Progress bar was stuck at 5% during "Setup Existing MO2" operation.

### Root Cause
In `/home/luke/Documents/NaK-Python/src/core/mo2_installer.py`:
- Line 35: `set_progress_callback()` was incorrectly setting `self.log_callback` instead of `self.progress_callback`

### Fix
**File:** `src/core/mo2_installer.py`
- **Line 35:** Changed `self.log_callback = callback` → `self.progress_callback = callback`
- Added `_send_progress_update()` helper method (lines 66-70) to send progress updates
- Updated `setup_existing()` to send real progress updates at: 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 60%, 95%

**File:** `/home/luke/Documents/NaK-Python/nak-flet/main.py`
- Removed all artificial progress stages with `time.sleep()` from `run_setup()` function
- Set up proper progress callback that receives backend updates
- Progress now reflects actual backend operations instead of fake delays

---

## 2. Text/Terminology Changes

### Change 1: Removed "comprehensive" from dependency text
**File:** `src/core/dependency_installer.py`
- **Line 240:** Changed "Installing {len(dependencies)} comprehensive dependencies" → "Installing {len(dependencies)} dependencies"
- **Reason:** User feedback - "sounds dumb otherwise"

### Change 2: Removed "HEROIC METHOD" prefix
**File:** `src/core/dependency_installer.py`
- **Lines 1625, 1673, 1688, 1702:** Removed "HEROIC METHOD:" prefix from GUI messages
- Changed to: "Starting winetricks installation with Proton...", etc.
- **Reason:** User feedback - "it's no longer the heroic method its just the normal setup now"

---

## 3. Major Refactoring: Renamed "HEROIC" to "BUNDLED WINETRICKS"

### Changes Throughout `dependency_installer.py`

**Method Names:**
- `_install_dependencies_with_heroic()` → Kept the name but updated all references and logs
- All internal logging changed from "HEROIC METHOD" to "BUNDLED WINETRICKS"

**Log Messages Updated (lines 859-882, 1530-1708):**
```python
# OLD:
"HEROIC WINETRICKS METHOD AVAILABLE"
"This is the faster method"

# NEW:
"BUNDLED WINETRICKS + PROTON METHOD AVAILABLE"
"This is the standard method - self-contained and reliable"
```

**Return Types Changed:**
- `"method": "heroic_winetricks_*"` → `"method": "bundled_winetricks_*"`

---

## 4. CRITICAL: Removed ALL Protontricks Code

### User's Emphatic Feedback
> **"PROTONTRICKS IS NOT REQUIRED AT ALL THAT WINETRICKS IS THE NORMAL METHOD!"**
> **"PROTONTRICKS SHOULDNT BE MENTIONED AT ALL OR USED AT ALL NO PROTONTRICKS!"**

### What Was Removed

**File:** `src/core/dependency_installer.py`

1. **Removed protontricks fallback from error messages (lines 1673, 1688, 1702):**
   - ❌ "Installation failed, will fallback to protontricks"
   - ✅ "Installation failed - bundled winetricks returned an error"

2. **Simplified `_install_dependencies_with_list()` (~368 lines removed):**
   - ❌ Removed entire protontricks fallback section (old lines 884-1221)
   - ✅ Now ONLY uses bundled winetricks + Proton
   - ✅ Returns error if Proton not found (no fallback to protontricks)

3. **Removed protontricks validation methods:**
   - ❌ Deleted `_validate_protontricks_working()` method
   - ❌ Deleted `_test_protontricks_basic()` method

4. **Removed protontricks registry method:**
   - ❌ Deleted `_apply_wine_registry_settings()` (protontricks version, lines 848-955)
   - ✅ Only `_apply_wine_registry_settings_self_contained()` remains

5. **Removed unused helper methods:**
   - ❌ Deleted `_install_proton_dependencies()` method
   - ❌ Deleted `_command_exists()` method

6. **Updated docstrings:**
   - Changed `_get_heroic_wine_binary_for_steam()` from "faster than protontricks" → "Get Proton's Wine binary for use with Steam games"

### Result
**Bundled winetricks + Proton is now the ONLY dependency installation method.**
- No protontricks
- No fallbacks
- Self-contained, reliable installation

---

## 5. Added Steam Restart Logic

### Feature Added
Automatically restart Steam after MO2 setup completes to ensure Steam picks up changes.

### Implementation
**File:** `src/core/dependency_installer.py` (lines 282-311)

**Location:** At the end of `install_mo2_dependencies_for_game()`, after .NET SDK installation

**Logic:**
1. Try to kill Steam: `pkill -9 steam`
2. Check if Steam was running:
   - **Steam WAS running** (return code 0): Wait 10 seconds for full shutdown
   - **Steam was NOT running** (return code non-zero): Wait 5 seconds
3. **Always start Steam**: `subprocess.Popen(["steam"])`

**Code:**
```python
try:
    # Try to kill Steam (won't error if it's not running)
    result = subprocess.run(["pkill", "-9", "steam"], timeout=30, capture_output=True)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        self.logger.info("Steam was running and has been stopped")
        self._log_progress("Steam stopped - waiting 10 seconds...")
        time.sleep(10)  # Wait for full shutdown
    else:
        self.logger.info("Steam was not running")
        self._log_progress("Steam was not running - waiting 5 seconds...")
        time.sleep(5)  # Wait before starting

    # Always start Steam after waiting
    self.logger.info("Starting Steam...")
    self._log_progress("Starting Steam...")
    subprocess.Popen(["steam"])
    self.logger.info("Steam started successfully")
    self._log_progress("Steam started successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.warning(f"Failed to restart Steam: {e}")
    self._log_progress(f"Warning: Failed to restart Steam - please start manually")
```

**Why:** Ensures Steam is always running after MO2 setup, even if it wasn't running before.

## 6. Files Modified

1. **`/home/luke/Documents/NaK-Python/src/core/mo2_installer.py`**
   - Fixed `set_progress_callback()` bug (line 35)
   - Added `_send_progress_update()` helper (lines 66-70)
   - Updated `setup_existing()` with real progress tracking

2. **`/home/luke/Documents/NaK-Python/nak-flet/main.py`**
   - Removed artificial progress with `time.sleep()`
   - Set up proper progress callback integration

3. **`/home/luke/Documents/NaK-Python/src/core/dependency_installer.py`**
   - Removed "comprehensive" text (line 240)
   - Renamed all "HEROIC" references to "BUNDLED WINETRICKS"
   - Removed ALL protontricks code (~500+ lines removed)
   - Added Steam restart logic (lines 282-311)

---

## 7. Next Steps / Future Work

### User's Next Focus
- **Save linker implementation**
- **Working with other prefixes (not just Steam)**

### Notes for Future Development
- Current implementation is Steam-focused (uses `steamapps/compatdata/`)
- For non-Steam prefixes, will need to:
  - Locate Wine prefix differently (not from Steam compatdata)
  - May still use bundled winetricks + Wine/Proton binary
  - Registry and .NET SDK installation methods already support both Wine and Proton

---

## Summary

### What Works Now
✅ Real progress tracking during MO2 setup (no more stuck at 5%)
✅ Bundled winetricks + Proton is the ONLY method (no protontricks)
✅ Cleaner, more accurate messaging in GUI
✅ Automatic Steam restart after MO2 setup
✅ Self-contained, reliable dependency installation

### What Was Removed
❌ ~500+ lines of protontricks fallback code
❌ Protontricks validation methods
❌ Artificial progress delays with `time.sleep()`
❌ Confusing "HEROIC METHOD" terminology
❌ Misleading "comprehensive dependencies" text

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single installation method:** Bundled winetricks + Proton (or Wine)
- **No external dependencies:** Everything bundled in AppImage
- **No fallbacks:** If Proton not found, return error (don't try protontricks)
- **Progress tracking:** Real backend progress, not artificial stages
