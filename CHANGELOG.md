1.4.0 4/30/25

Here's a changelog as well:
[Sky Text Opti](https://github.com/BenHUET/sky-tex-opti) has been added, it is a native tool that plans to recreate and do what VRAMr does better and faster. Currently it's faster and we only have one mode for right now, planning to have more in the future.

DotNet9 SDK has been added and will install alongside basic dependencies, this is for synthesis (tbh i have no idea if it's actually working correctly, please let me know)

Show dot files has now been added so that way you can access .local/steam or .steam when running mo2 if you don't want to make a separate stock game folder.

[CKPE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71371)  has now been given support with basic dependencies as well via winhttp, and d3dcompiler_46, I do need to warn you dark mode doesn't work yet as it relies on Windows Aero, which wine/proton can't do yet.

And finally I have provided a fix for Xedit users which now allows you to drag and drop in columns. Said fix can be found/mentioned [here.](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/issues/774)
