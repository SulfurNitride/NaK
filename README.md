NaK, is a sodium and potassium alloy. Highly reactive.

NaK, is a modding helper. It automatically sets up MO2 and Vortex to the best of my abilities for you. Using the python vdf editor for adding things to steam as a non steam game, auto installs dependencies for you. Sets up NXM Links as well. Includes fixes for XEdit, Synthesis, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. 

If you have any requests or anything just let me know or open up an issue!

You can find me in the [NaK Discord](https://discord.gg/9JWQzSeUWt)

Requirements:
- Flatpak or system package of protontricks
- Only system binary of steam (flatpak steam is not supported)
- Proton Experimental
