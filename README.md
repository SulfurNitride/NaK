NaK, is a sodium and potassium alloy. Highly reactive.

A Bash script I made with DeepSeek and Claude that should work with all major Linux distros that sets up mod manager downloads for MO2 in Proton, and installs _almost_ all dependencies for the modlists you make via Protontricks.

The script can be run by piping directly to Bash 
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SulfurNitride/NaK/refs/heads/main/nak-installer.sh)
```

Or With SH
```
sh -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SulfurNitride/NaK/refs/heads/main/install-nak.sh)"
```
Alternatively, you may run this script by downloading a local copy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SulfurNitride/NaK.git
cd NaK/
chmod +x ./nak-installer.sh 
bash ./nak-installer.sh
```
