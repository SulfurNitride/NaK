BIG NOTE! I'm working on a different project, called [Fluorine Manager](https://github.com/SulfurNitride/Fluorine-Manager) so I probably won't update NaK as much anymore. Fluorine Manager is a native Linux MO2 port.

NaK, is a sodium and potassium alloy. Highly reactive.

NaK, is a modding helper. It automatically sets up MO2 to the best of my abilities for you. Auto installs dependencies for you and sets up NXM Links as well. Includes fixes for XEdit, Synthesis, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. 

If you have any requests or anything just let me know or open up an issue!

You can find me in the [NaK Discord](https://discord.gg/9JWQzSeUWt) 

If you want to support the things I put out, I do have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/sulfurnitride) I will never charge money for any of my content.

FAQ can be found [here](https://github.com/SulfurNitride/NaK/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md).

To run it:

Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/SulfurNitride/NaK/releases) tab. And it should just be as easy as double clicking it. The GUI should also be compatibile with the Steamdeck.

Requirements:
- Steam... (Flatpak steam needs testing!)
- A proton, I recommend using a GE 10+ from either ProtonPlus or ProtonUp-QT
