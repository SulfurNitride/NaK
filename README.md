NaK, is a sodium and potassium alloy. Highly reactive.

NaK, is a modding helper. It automatically sets up MO2 and Vortex to the best of my abilities for you. Auto installs dependencies for you and sets up NXM Links as well. Includes fixes for XEdit, Synthesis, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. 

If you have any requests or anything just let me know or open up an issue!

To run it:

Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/SulfurNitride/NaK/releases) tab. And it should just be as easy as double clicking it. The GUI should also be compatibile with the Steamdeck.

Requirements:
- Steam... (Flatpak steam needs testing!)
- A proton!
