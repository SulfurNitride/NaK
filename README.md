NaK, is a sodium and potassium alloy. Highly reactive.

NaK, is a modding helper. It automatically setup's up MO2, Vortex, and Limo to the best of my abilities for you. Using STL Binary for adding things to steam as a non steam game, auto installs dependencies for you. Sets up NXM Links as well. Includes fixes for XEdit, Synthesis, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. 

If you have any requests or anything just let me know or open up an issue!

Requirements: Flatpak or system package of protontricks, and only system binary of steam! (flatpak steam is not supported), and have Proton Experimental.
